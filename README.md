# Pitch-Sequencing-RNN
Can I use a Recurrent Neural Network To Automate MLB Pitch Sequences?


## Goal
I am looking to refine my Recurrent Neural Network skills by using a new library, Pytorch in Python. I am curious to see if there is a way to predict what pitch will come based on the prior pitches in an at-bat.

## Hypothesis
Do I think I will be successful? Probably not. But, I think I can learn something along the way about how pitch sequences are built. Whether it is through my intial EDA, through my data cleaning and feature engineering, or my actual modeling, something new will come from this!


## Data
Using data from October 6, 2024. It is postseason pitch data for all games and all pitches. This was taken from a kaggle competition.
